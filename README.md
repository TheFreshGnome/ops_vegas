Overview of the simple blinking LED game
Basically there are three lights that alternate color and need to be aligned to the same color by the end. You simply press the button when the light is the desired color (Red, green, or blue) and do that for all three lights on time. Success is indicated at the end with flashing green lights, and failure is indicated with red lights. It is very simple and designed for the programmer to practice controlling the button's input in Arduino.For example one was for the microcontroller (Teensy LC, https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/teensyLC.html) to register exactly one button click instead of multiple or none at all when actually being pressed. The code file shows exactly what goes on, but basically  by utilizing the "millis" and "attachInterrupt" keyword we can control the amount of input read for each time the button is pressed. This project helped me in practicing writing working logic for a simple system, and improving mastery in the Arduino IDE.
